Ticket management system is created in which one user should be able to raise tickets, stored in data base & view the status and the assignee one can see the ticket and update the status.

Each user can create the ticket and set the owner/assignee as per their choice and then only owner/assignee can edit their own tickets which is achieved by using permission classes.

requirements.txt file is provided for dependencies.
